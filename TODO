General:
- names for objects: threads, mailboxes, state machine states, loggers
- object name: the last part is the name passed to constructor,
               previous parts come from dynamic scope

State machines:
- function decorator (logs state changes, updates the current state observable)
- handle substates/submachines

Thread:
- support functions and threads in Source:register_thread
- resume(function, ...) means T.go(function, ...)
- short-lived thread name is based on the event source name
- unify callback_list and nice_list? (spawning threads from functions in nice_list)
- unbuffered Mailboxes (with blocking writes)
- optimize Mailbox implementation
- T.recv introspection (see which thread is blocked on which sources)
